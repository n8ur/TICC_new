Changes to Rev. B board -- 1 May 2016

Implemented on boards #3 and #4:

1.  Add 2.7k pullups on INTBA and INTBB. ADDED (at IC5 and IC6 inputs)

2.  Route STOPA and STOPB to Arduino Pins 6 and 7 respectively.  ADDED

3.  Add 100K pulldowns on STARTA and STARTB. ADDED (at SMA connectors)

4.  Change IC1, IC2, IC5, IC6, IC15 from 74LVC1G07 (open drain buffer)
    to 74LVC1G08 (ADD gate) with inputs paralleled. DONE

5.  Change C9/C14 and C10/C11 from 0.001 to 0.1uF.  DONE

6.  Add ground wire between C9/C14.

Additional Changes for Rev. C:

A.  Add voltage translators for STOPA and STOPB

B.  Add jumpers so that channel A stop signal can come from stop gate,
    or directly from channel B SMA.  This would provide a single channel
    configuration that would allow more measurements/second but with a
    maximum time interval limited by the TDC chip.

C.  Check bypass cap grounds for good ties to ground plane.

D.  Consider location of input SMAs for clearance with Arduino USB jack.
