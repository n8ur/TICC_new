Changes from TADD rev A to rev B board:

1.  Repair broken footprint for TXB0108 chip and reroute.  Quite a bit of
    general routing cleanup.

2.  Replace edge-mount SMA connectors X1 and X2 with 4-hole versions.

3.  Remove 74LVC1G06 and jumpers to allow for inverted input.  Falling
    edge can be selected by commands to the TDC7200 chips.  Datasheet
    recommends using rising edge for best results, though.  Future project
    to do a front-end board with Wenzel circuit, inverter, etc.

4.  Add U16 to further square the output of the sine-square converter.
    There's a fair bit of capacitance on the 100NS line and the waveform
    was none to good on the rev A board.  This should improve that.

5.  Changes all net names and silkscreen to refer to the two inputs as
    channels A and B rather than 0 and 1.  This is to make it easier and
    less confusing to talk about the design.  I'm also going to try to
    refer to the external pulses that drive the channels as "events."
    This terminology is more consistent with counter-speak.
